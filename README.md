# weather_api
axios is a dependency that will call the APIs that we need it is very similar to fetch()

dotenv is a dev dependency that will help us to load the api key

We have added .env and node_modules to .gitignore because we do
not want to check them into version control , we do not want to expose our API key anywhere
